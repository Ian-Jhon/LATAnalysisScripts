Changelog for LATAnalysisScripts

	version	0.1.0	September 2011
			initial version

	version 0.1.1 	October 2011 

			trial release, includes all changes to quickPlot
			including implementing logging and a configuration
			file

	version 0.1.2 	November 2011

			Changed the command line arguments to take the
			sourcename as a variable to the option -n and not
			as a standalone option.  Made the command line
			options uiform over all of the command line tools.
			Added a smoothing feature in quickPlot that can
			use either an adaptive smoothing routine (fadapt)
			or a rebinning.  The binning factor is set in the
			config variable 'binfactor'.  0 means there will
			be no binning.  Changed the calculation for the
			significance map from a Li & Ma type to a
			different one.

	version 0.1.3 	January 2011

			Added the ability to remove and store a source for
			reloading later.  Bugfixes as well that are listed
			in the git repository.

	version 0.1.4rc	February 2012

			Fixed bug that determines the size of the exposure
			map in a binned analysis.  Checks for make2FGLxml.
			Updated the point source catalog name.  Can now
			use a custom XML model for the NewMinuit optimizer
			and in the calculation of the ModelMap.  This is a
			release candidate to prepare for an initial public
			release.

	version 0.1.5	February 10, 2012

			Added several CLI options to quickAnalyis.  Fixed
			-h/--help CLI options.  Added check that the
			source of interest is in the model in the
			removeWeak function.  Almost ready for release
			here.

	version 0.1.6	February 15, 2012

			Added a default of 25 for the binning in fadapt in
			quickPlot.  Checks for fversion instead of HEADAS
			to verify that the ftools are setup.  Added a
			--filter option to quickAnalysis which runs
			gtselect and gtmktime.  This version will be
			released.

	version 0.1.7	February 24, 2012

			Changed the default size of the binned exposure
			cube (and thus the source map) to 30 degrees
			larger than the ROI.  Made this variable user
			adjustable.

	version 0.1.8	March 1, 2012

			Fixed a double fitting bug in fitMIN.

	version 0.1.9	May 1, 2012

			Added a function to quickPlot that plots the
			significance distribution of the significance map
			as well as overplots a gaussian based on the
			moments of that distribution.  This is useful in
			figuring out what features are actually
			significant in the significance map.  Also changed
			the method for calculating the significance in the
			significance map.

	version 0.1.10	Sep 19, 2012

			Added 'convtype' to the analysis section of the
			config file so that you can do a front/back
			analysis directly.  Make sure you update your
			config file to add this option otherwise you'll
			get an error on start.  Also changed the runCCUBE
			to provide the spacecraft file as an
			option (needed for the newer science tools).

	version 0.1.11	Dec 5, 2012

			The output of the printSource command only
			displays 2 decimal points.  It also displays the
			scale factor for all parameters.  Added a
			'pokeSource' function in quickLike that changes a
			parameter for a source.  This is useful to promote
			convergence or to verify a fit.


	version 0.2.0 Nov 15, 2013

	         Lots of changes in this version.  This is the
             initial release of the quickCurve program.  This
             program will create a lightcurve from Fermi LAT
             data (type 'quickCurve -h' for more details).
             This version also integrates with the gtapps_mp
             programs (found at the FSSC user contributed
             tools or at https://github.com/kialio/gtapps_mp).
             These tools will execute certain gt programs in a
             multithreaded way greatly reducting execution
             time if you have a multicore machine.  There is
             now a 'multicore' option in the common config
             panel.  If this is greater than 1 then the code
             will try and use the gtapps_mp programs if they
             have been installed.  This version has also been
             updated for the P7 Reprocessed data.  It is
             recommended that you create a new config file if
             you upgrade to this version.
